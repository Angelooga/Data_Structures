 Allocate memory for nodes
struct Node first = 
  (struct Node )malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
struct Node second =
  (struct Node )malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
struct Node last =
  (struct Node )malloc(sizeof(struct Node));

 Initilize nodes
first-data = 2;
second-data = 3;
last-data = 4;

 Connect nodes
first-next = second;
second-next = last;
last-next = first;
